An enhanced version of [dorothy](http://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy), a wonderful template for [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto), the blogging engine. 

Sprinkled some [karakuri](http://github.com/5v3n/karakuri) magic atop of dorothy, enabling you to

- tag your posts
- use seo friendly page titles
- use the disqus comment counter

Please be aware that you need to enter your disqus id in the `config.ru` in order to make the comments & comment counter work. And mind to use your bit.ly api credentials in the corresponding line in `templates/pages/articles` to automagically shorten your URLs for social sharing purpose.

Enjoy!
